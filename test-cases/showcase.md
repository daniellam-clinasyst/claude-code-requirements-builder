# 🧪 Test Cases Showcase - Opus 4.1 Improvements

This document demonstrates the new capabilities implemented for the Claude Requirements Builder optimized for Opus 4.1.

---

## Test Case 1: Natural Language Understanding

### Scenario: User responds with various natural language inputs

**Old System** (Only accepts y/n):
```
AI: Will this feature need authentication?
User: definitely
AI: ❌ Invalid input. Please answer with y/n/idk
```

**New System** (Natural language processing):
```
AI: Will this feature need authentication?
User: definitely
AI: ✅ Yes

User: not really
AI: ❌ No

User: yes, but only for admin users
AI: ⚠️ Conditional: only for admin users
    Follow-up: Should we create a separate admin permission level? (y/n/idk)
```

### Test Variations:
- "absolutely" → ✅ Yes
- "nope" → ❌ No
- "depends on the user role" → ⚠️ Conditional response with follow-up
- "👍" → ✅ Yes (emoji support)

## Test Case 2: Dynamic Question Generation

### Scenario: Different complexity levels generate different question counts

**Simple Feature** - "Add a contact form"
```
Complexity Analysis: simple (score: 0.35)
Domain: ui_component
Questions Generated: 3

Q1: Will users interact through a visual interface? (Priority: 1)
Q2: Should this work on mobile devices? (Priority: 1)
Q3: Must this meet WCAG accessibility standards? (Priority: 1)
```

**Complex Feature** - "Implement enterprise authentication system with SSO"
```
Complexity Analysis: complex (score: 0.85)
Domain: authentication
Questions Generated: 8

Q1: Will this be the primary authentication method? (Priority: 1)
Q2: Should users verify their email address? (Priority: 1)
Q3: Will you need role-based access control? (Priority: 1)
Q4: Do you need social authentication providers? (Priority: 2)
Q5: Should the system support "Remember Me"? (Priority: 2)
Q6: Will you need single sign-on (SSO)? (Priority: 3)
Q7: Do you need two-factor authentication? (Priority: 3)
Q8: Should passwords follow strict complexity rules? (Priority: 2)
```

---

## Test Case 3: Smart Context Recap

### Scenario: User returns after 2 hours to continue

**Old System**:
```
Current requirement: user-authentication
Phase: Discovery Questions
Progress: 3/5 questions answered
```

**New System**:
```
📌 Quick recap: We're gathering requirements for **user authentication system**

You last worked on this 2 hours ago.
**Progress**: Discovery Phase - 3/5 questions answered

[███████░░░] 60%

**Key Decisions So Far**:
  ✅ Primary authentication method
  ✅ Email verification required
  ✅ Role-based access control

**Implications**:
  ℹ️ Email verification adds complexity but improves security
  💡 Consider adding password complexity requirements

**Next Question** (Impact: high):
  "Do you need two-factor authentication support?"
  (2 questions remaining)

💡 Tip: Use "idk" for any question to use smart defaults
```

---

## Test Case 4: Learning System Defaults

### Scenario: System learns from previous sessions

**First Session** (No learning data):
```
Q: Should we use JWT tokens for session management?
Default: yes (industry standard)
User: no
```

**After 5 Sessions** (Pattern detected):
```
Q: Should we use JWT tokens for session management?
Default: no (based on your team's preference - 80% chose 'no')
User: no
System: ✓ Learning confirmed
```

**Learning Insights Generated**:
```json
{
  "strong_preferences": [
    {
      "pattern": "jwt_tokens",
      "preference": "no",
      "confidence": 0.8
    }
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Your team prefers session-based auth over JWT"
  ]
}
```

## Test Case 5: Template System

### Scenario: User wants to build authentication quickly

**Old System**:
```
/requirements-start add user authentication
[Must answer all 10-14 questions]
Time: ~45 minutes
```

**New System**:
```
/requirements-start add user authentication --template auth

✨ Using Authentication Template
📋 Pre-answered 8 common questions based on best practices
⏱️ Time saved: 45 minutes

Focus Questions (only 3 remaining):
Q1: Do you need social authentication providers? (Default: no)
Q2: Do you need two-factor authentication? (Default: no)
Q3: Will you need single sign-on (SSO)? (Default: no)
```

---

## Test Case 6: Conditional Response Handling

### Scenario: User provides conditional answer

```
AI: Should this feature be available to all users?
User: yes, but premium users get extra features

AI: ⚠️ Conditional response detected: "premium users get extra features"

✓ Base feature available to all users
📝 Note added: Premium tier includes additional features

Follow-up: Should we show locked premium features to free users? (y/n/idk)
User: yes

Generated Requirement:
- Feature accessible to all authenticated users
- Premium features visible but locked for free users
- Upgrade prompts when free users try premium features
```

---

## Test Case 7: Visual Progress Indicators

### Scenario: Progress visualization throughout session

```
Phase 1: Codebase Analysis
[██████████] 100% ✅

Phase 2: Discovery Questions
[████████░░] 80% (4/5 answered)

Phase 3: Context Gathering
[██████████] 100% ✅

Phase 4: Expert Questions
[████░░░░░░] 40% (2/5 answered)

Overall Progress: 70% complete
Estimated time remaining: 5 minutes
```

---

## Test Case 8: Intelligent Question Routing

### Scenario: Questions adapt based on previous answers

```
Q1: Will you need role-based access control?
User: no

[System skips SSO question since it requires roles]

Q2: Do you need email verification?
User: yes

[System adds related security question]

Q3: Since you want email verification, should we also implement account lockout after failed attempts?
User: yes
```

---

## Test Case 9: Multi-Mode Support

### Quick Mode (Expert User + Simple Feature):
```
/requirements-start add footer component

🚀 Quick Mode Activated (Expert user + simple requirement)
Only 3 essential questions:

Q1: Mobile responsive? (y)
Q2: Dark mode support? (y) 
Q3: Accessibility compliant? (y)

✅ Requirements generated in 2 minutes
```

### Deep Dive Mode (Complex Feature):
```
/requirements-start implement payment processing

🔍 Deep Dive Mode Activated (Complex requirement detected)
Comprehensive 10-question analysis:

[Detailed questions about PCI compliance, payment providers, refunds, etc.]
```

---

## Test Case 10: Error Recovery

### Scenario: Session interrupted, graceful recovery

```
[Session interrupted at question 4]

/requirements-status

⚠️ Detected interrupted session from 3 hours ago

Recovering context...
✅ Successfully restored 4 answered questions
